*** 21
**** =12:25= getstring command feels clunky
when dynamic input is turned on ctrl+v doesn't work, pasteclip command is invoked instead
pressing space is interpreted as confirmation of the command rather than space in the string unless double quotes are used
for the command I'm setting up (rename tabs) a preview similar to that in rename commands in revit-ballet would be more practical
***** autolisp doesn't seem to have robust facilities for creating windows/windows forms
seems to expect separate .dcl files
writing them in the same files seems hard to modify
may move this command to .net instead
*** 22
**** =10:03= ai suggests that .net may offer better faciilities to manage multiple opened documents
autolisp scripts resorted to activex, which although worked, sounds like a legacy solution that wouldn't be suitable for going forward
